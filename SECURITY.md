## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in aero-pi-cam, please report it responsibly.

**How to report:**

Please report security vulnerabilities using the [GitHub Security Advisories form](https://github.com/CaenFalaisePlaneurs/aero-pi-cam/security/advisories/new).

**Include the following information:**
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)
   - Your contact information (optional, but helpful for follow-up questions)

**After submission:**

Once you submit the security advisory, a draft will be created. You can:
- Privately discuss the vulnerability with us
- Create a temporary private fork where you can collaborate on a fix
- If you have already fixed the vulnerability, simply fill out the draft security advisory and publish it

**What to expect:**

- You will receive an acknowledgment within a week (we are only volunteer maintainers).
- We will investigate the report and provide an initial assessment as soon as possible depending on our availability.
- If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work on a fix and keep you updated on progress
- Once a fix is ready, we will release a security update and credit you (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- If the vulnerability is declined, we will explain why

**Please do not:**
- Open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
- Disclose the vulnerability publicly before a fix is available
- Attempt to exploit the vulnerability on production systems

We take security seriously and appreciate your help in keeping aero-pi-cam secure.
